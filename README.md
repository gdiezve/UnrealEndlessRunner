# Third person endless runner
This is an Unreal Engine 5 project develop to learn the basics of this Game Engine and how to use blueprints, by implementing a simple endless runner mechanic, where the player needs to collect coins while avoiding some obstacles and trying not to fall from the main path. 

Here you can find some screenshots of the runnning game:
